## Configuration

Window-Switcher offers various customization options to tailor its behavior to your preferences. You can define custom keyboard shortcuts, enable or disable specific features, and fine-tune settings through a configuration file.

To personalize Window-Switcher, you'll need a configuration file named `window-switcher.ini`. This file should be placed in the same directory as the `window-switcher.exe` file. Once you've made changes to the configuration, make sure to restart Window-Switcher so your new settings can take effect.

Here is the default configuration:

```ini
# Whether to show trayicon, yes/no
trayicon = yes 

[switch-windows]

# Hotkey to switch windows
hotkey = alt+`

# List of hotkey conflict apps
# e.g. game1.exe,game2.exe
blacklist =

# Ignore minimal windows
ignore_minimal = no

# Only switch within the current virtual desktops: yes/no/auto
only_current_desktop = auto

[switch-apps]

# Whether to enable switching apps
enable = no 

# Hotkey to switch apps
hotkey = alt+tab

# Ignore minimal windows
ignore_minimal = no

# Only switch apps within the current virtual desktops: yes/no/auto
only_current_desktop = auto
```

## Running as Administrator (Optional)

The window-switcher works in standard user mode. But only the window-switcher running in administrator mode can manage applications running in administrator mode.

**Important:** If you enable the startup option while running in standard user mode, it will launch in standard mode upon system reboot. To ensure startup with admin privileges, launch the window-switcher as administrator first before enabling startup.
