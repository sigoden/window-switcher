# Window Switcher

Window-Switcher offers hotkeys for quickly switching windows on Windows OS:

1. ```Alt+`(Backtick)```: switch between windows of the same app.

Tips: **Hold `Alt` and strike `Backtick/Tab` to cycle through, press `Alt + Backtick/Tab` to switch to the previous one.**

## Install

 Download `windows-switcher.zip` from the [Github Release](https://github.com/sigoden/windows-switcher/releases), extract `window-switcher.exe`, run it. 

> window-switcher.exe is a portable single-file program (less than 1 MB in size). No installation is required.


## Configuration

The window-switcher supports custom shortcuts, enabling and disabling certain functions, and all of these can be set through the configuration file.

The configuration file must be named `window-switcher.ini` and located in the same directory as `window-switcher.exe` for the changes to take effect.  

Here is the default configuration:

```ini
# Whether to show trayicon, yes/no
trayicon = yes 

[switch-windows]

# Hotkey to switch windows
hotkey = alt+`

# List of hotkey conflict apps
# e.g. game1.exe,game2.exe
blacklist =

# Ignore minimal windows
ignore_minimal = no

[switch-apps]

# Whether to enable switching apps
enable = no 

# Hotkey to switch apps
hotkey = alt+tab

# Ignore minimal windows
ignore_minimal = no
```

## Running as Administrator (Optional)

While not mandatory, running `window-switcher.exe` with administrator privileges unlocks its full potential, especially when working with system applications like Task Manager that require elevated permissions. This allows for smoother interactions with all types of applications.

**Administrator Privileges and Startup Option:**

* **Running as Admin + Enabling Startup:** Launches `window-switcher.exe` with administrator privileges every time you start your computer.
* **Running without Admin + Enabling Startup:** Launches `window-switcher.exe` with regular user privileges at startup.
